# Test App - Google Sheets Input Saver

## 📌 Overview
This is a **test application** built for experimenting with sending data from an input field directly into a specific Google Sheet.  
It’s not intended for production use — just a proof-of-concept to test the workflow.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User types text into an input field.
2. When submitted, the text is sent to a Google Sheets document.
3. The Google Sheet is pre-configured to receive the data.

## 🚀 Purpose
- To test basic form input handling.
- To verify Google Sheets API integration.
- To explore sending data from a front-end app to a Google Sheet in real time.

## 📝 Notes
- This app is for **testing only**.
- No authentication or validation is implemented.
- The target Google Sheet must already be set up and connected to the app.
